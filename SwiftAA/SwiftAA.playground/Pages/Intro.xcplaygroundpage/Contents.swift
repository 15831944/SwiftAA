//: ## Foreword
//: SwiftAA is the most complete and accurate set of astronomical algorithms available for Swift.
//: It originates from the development of the professionnal app [iObserve](http://onekilopars.ec/iobserve)
//: and available since 2010 on macOS (and also on iPad).
//: It has been downloaded thousands of times around the world, and is used in all
//: major observatories on this planet, from world-class VLT, Keck, Gemini to smaller ones in people's backyard.
//: At some point the natural wish of making a much better version 2 of this app appeared. To do so, some
//: new UI components would need to be developed, as well as a much improved set of algorithms. Interestingly, 
//: the Swift language just appaeared at similar epoch.
//:
//: I had already quite some experience with implementing astronomical algorithms from the reference textbook
//: *Astronomical Algorithms* (AA) written by Jean Meeus. But with ambitious goals for iObserve2, I would need to
//: implement lots of them. And a good programmer knows when to reuse code, rather than implementing it again.
//: So I contacted Paul J. Naughter, whose [website](http://www.naughter.com/aa.html)
//: offer precisely this: a fairly complete implementation of AA algorithms, called **AA+**. 
//: He agreed to let me put his code
//: on a GitHub repository and develop my own solution, as long as its code retained the licence, and he remains the
//: only master source of AA+ code. **So here comes SwiftAA!**
//: 
//: SwiftAA was first developed for an easy use in the development of apps, among which the coming iObserve 2.
//: But with the advent of Playgrounds, SwiftAA could become a lot more interesting. It could become a truly
//: **educational tool**. Hence this Playground. Ultimately, my dream would be to see the SwiftAA playground
//: become a kind of some highschool course. With examples, graphs, animations...
//:
//: To achieve this goal, SwiftAA has been extented to not only contains AA+ algorithms, but also much more expressive
//: APIs and functions and conversions and all that makes the use of Swift a lot simpler and fun.
